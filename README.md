### About This Site

I have been looking to do a redesign of this site for a while now. A couple months ago, I built this site in React, but the design was not quite up to par.

I stumbled upon [Willian Justen's Jekyll theme](https://github.com/willianjusten/will-jekyll-template), I fell in love with it. It was a better experience than what my site was offering so I decided to port it over to React and SCSS from Jekyll and Stylus.

### Future Work
- Document setup, components, and SCSS
- Publish as an easy-setup repository for others
- Connect to a CMS (content management system)
- Finish building out additional components
- Hook up search
- (Long Term) switch SCSS styles to be more atomic (compositional)
