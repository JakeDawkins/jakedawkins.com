### This is an old build of my site

Currently, I'm using [Ghost CMS](https://ghost.org) to maintain my site. You can read more about this decision [here](jakedawkins.com/about-this-site).

I'll keep this repository open for reference, but it will not be actively updated.

### About This Site

I have been looking to do a redesign of this site for a while now. A couple months ago, I built this site in React, but the design was not quite up to par.

I stumbled upon [Willian Justen's Jekyll theme](https://github.com/willianjusten/will-jekyll-template), I fell in love with it. It was a better experience than what my site was offering so I decided to port it over to React and SCSS from Jekyll and Stylus.
