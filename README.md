## Deploy

Assuming you're deploying to github pages, You will need to have this repository set up with your own GitHub repository, and have write privileges.

You will need to change the CNAME file generation in the deploy script to match your url.

`package.json > scripts > deploy`

With both of those steps done, deploying is as easy as running `yarn deploy`
