It analyzes\n\t * the geometry of elements, and observes when another responder (scroll view\n\t * etc) has stolen the touch lock. It notifies your component when it should\n\t * give feedback to the user. (bouncing/highlighting/unhighlighting).\n\t *\n\t * - When a touch was activated (typically you highlight)\n\t * - When a touch was deactivated (typically you unhighlight)\n\t * - When a touch was \"pressed\" - a touch ended while still within the geometry\n\t *   of the element, and no other element (like scroller) has \"stolen\" touch\n\t *   lock (\"responder\") (Typically you bounce the element).\n\t *\n\t * A good tap interaction isn't as simple as you might think. There should be a\n\t * slight delay before showing a highlight when starting a touch. If a\n\t * subsequent touch move exceeds the boundary of the element, it should\n\t * unhighlight, but if that same touch is brought back within the boundary, it\n\t * should rehighlight again. A touch can move in and out of that boundary\n\t * several times, each time toggling highlighting, but a \"press\" is only\n\t * triggered if that touch ends while within the element's boundary and no\n\t * scroller (or anything else) has stolen the lock on touches.\n\t *\n\t * To create a new type of component that handles interaction using the\n\t * `Touchable` mixin, do the following:\n\t *\n\t * - Initialize the `Touchable` state.\n\t *\n\t *   getInitialState: function() {\n\t *     return merge(this.touchableGetInitialState(), yourComponentState);\n\t *   }\n\t *\n\t * - Choose the rendered component who's touches should start the interactive\n\t *   sequence. On that rendered node, forward all `Touchable` responder\n\t *   handlers. You can choose any rendered node you like. Choose a node whose\n\t *   hit target you'd like to instigate the interaction sequence:\n\t *\n\t *   // In render function:\n\t *   return (\n\t *     <View\n\t *       onStartShouldSetResponder={this.touchableHandleStartShouldSetResponder}\n\t *       onResponderTerminationRequest={this.touchableHandleResponderTerminationRequest}\n\t *       onResponderGrant={this.touchableHandleResponderGrant}\n\t *       onResponderMove={this.touchableHandleResponderMove}\n\t *       onResponderRelease={this.touchableHandleResponderRelease}\n\t *       onResponderTerminate={this.touchableHandleResponderTerminate}>\n\t *       <View>\n\t *         Even though the hit detection/interactions are triggered by the\n\t *         wrapping (typically larger) node, we usually end up implementing\n\t *         custom logic that highlights this inner one.\n\t *       </View>\n\t *     </View>\n\t *   );\n\t *\n\t * - You may set up your own handlers for each of these events, so long as you\n\t *   also invoke the `touchable*` handlers inside of your custom handler.\n\t *\n\t * - Implement the handlers on your component class in order to provide\n\t *   feedback to the user. See documentation for each of these class methods\n\t *   that you should implement.\n\t *\n\t *   touchableHandlePress: function() {\n\t *      this.performBounceAnimation();  // or whatever you want to do.\n\t *   },\n\t *   touchableHandleActivePressIn: function() {\n\t *     this.beginHighlighting(...);  // Whatever you like to convey activation\n\t *   },\n\t *   touchableHandleActivePressOut: function() {\n\t *     this.endHighlighting(...);  // Whatever you like to convey deactivation\n\t *   },\n\t *\n\t * - There are more advanced methods you can implement (see documentation below):\n\t *   touchableGetHighlightDelayMS: function() {\n\t *     return 20;\n\t *   }\n\t *   // In practice, *always* use a predeclared constant (conserve memory).\n\t *   touchableGetPressRectOffset: function() {\n\t *     return {top: 20, left: 20, right: 20, bottom: 100};\n\t *   }\n\t */\n\t\n\t/**\n\t * Touchable states.\n\t */\n\tvar States = {\n\t  NOT_RESPONDER: 'NOT_RESPONDER', // Not the

The only way\n\t * to tell is if the `touchStart` occurred immediately after the\n\t * `onMomentumScrollEnd`.\n\t *\n\t * This is abstracted out for you, so you can just call this.scrollResponderIsAnimating() if\n\t * necessary\n\t *\n\t * `ScrollResponder` also includes logic for blurring a currently focused input\n\t * if one is focused while scrolling. The `ScrollResponder` is a natural place\n\t * to put this logic since it can support not dismissing the keyboard while\n\t * scrolling, unless a recognized \"tap\"-like gesture has occurred.\n\t *\n\t * The public lifecycle API includes events for keyboard interaction, responder\n\t * interaction, and scrolling (among others). The keyboard callbacks\n\t * `onKeyboardWill/Did/*` are *global* events, but are invoked on scroll\n\t * responder's props so that you can guarantee that the scroll responder's\n\t * internal state has been updated accordingly (and deterministically) by\n\t * the time the props callbacks are invoke. Otherwise, you would always wonder\n\t * if the scroll responder is currently in a state where it recognizes new\n\t * keyboard positions etc. If coordinating scrolling with keyboard movement,\n\t * *always* use these hooks instead of listening to your own global keyboard\n\t * events.\n\t *\n\t * Public keyboard lifecycle API: (props callbacks)\n\t *\n\t * Standard Keyboard Appearance Sequence:\n\t *\n\t *   this.props.onKeyboardWillShow\n\t *   this.props.onKeyboardDidShow\n\t *\n\t * `onScrollResponderKeyboardDismissed` will be invoked if an appropriate\n\t * tap inside the scroll responder's scrollable region was responsible\n\t * for the dismissal of the keyboard.

Therefore, `PanResponder` does not call\n\t   * `onResponderMove` passed the first dispatch.

It is not at all exhaustive, and will continue to change.\",\n\t  title: 'Jake Dawkins',\n\t  socialAccounts: [{\n\t    url: 'https://twitter.com/jakedawkins',\n\t    color: '#1ea1f2',\n\t    siteName: 'Twitter',\n\t    handle: '@jakedawkins'\n\t  }, {\n\t    url: 'https://github.com/jakedawkins',\n\t    color: '#25292f',\n\t    siteName: 'GitHub',\n\t    handle: '@jakedawkins'\n\t  }, {\n\t    url: 'https://medium.com/@jakedawkins',\n\t    color: '#03a87c',\n\t    siteName: 'Medium',\n\t    handle: '@jakedawkins'\n\t  }]\n\t};\n\tmodule.exports = exports['default'];\n\n/***/ }),\n/* 281 */,\n/* 282 */,\n/* 283 */,\n/* 284 */,\n/* 285 */,\n/* 286 */,\n/* 287 */,\n/* 288 */,\n/* 289 */,\n/* 290 */,\n/* 291 */,\n/* 292 */,\n/* 293 */,\n/* 294 */,\n/* 295 */,\n/* 296 */,\n/* 297 */,\n/* 298 */,\n/* 299 */,\n/* 300 */,\n/* 301 */,\n/* 302 */,\n/* 303 */,\n/* 304 */,\n/* 305 */,\n/* 306 */,\n/* 307 */,\n/* 308 */,\n/* 309 */,\n/* 310 */,\n/* 311 */,\n/* 312 */,\n/* 313 */,\n/* 314 */,\n/* 315 */\n/***/ (function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = {\"layoutContext\":{}}\n\n/***/ }),\n/* 316 */,\n/* 317 */,\n/* 318 */,\n/* 319 */,\n/* 320 */,\n/* 321 */,\n/* 322 */,\n/* 323 */,\n/* 324 */,\n/* 325 */,\n/* 326 */,\n/* 327 */,\n/* 328 */,\n/* 329 */,\n/* 330 */,\n/* 331 */,\n/* 332 */,\n/* 333 */,\n/* 334 */,\n/* 335 */,\n/* 336 */,\n/* 337 */,\n/* 338 */,\n/* 339 */,\n/* 340 */,\n/* 341 */,\n/* 342 */,\n/* 343 */,\n/* 344 */,\n/* 345 */,\n/* 346 */,\n/* 347 */,\n/* 348 */,\n/* 349 */,\n/* 350 */,\n/* 351 */,\n/* 352 */,\n/* 353 */,\n/* 354 */,\n/* 355 */,\n/* 356 */,\n/* 357 */,\n/* 358 */,\n/* 359 */,\n/* 360 */,\n/* 361 */,\n/* 362 */,\n/* 363 */,\n/* 364 */,\n/* 365 */,\n/* 366 */,\n/* 367 */\n/***/ (function(module, exports) {\n\n\texports.__esModule = true;\n\tvar ATTRIBUTE_NAMES = exports.ATTRIBUTE_NAMES = {\n\t    BODY: \"bodyAttributes\",\n\t    HTML: \"htmlAttributes\",\n\t    TITLE: \"titleAttributes\"\n\t};\n\t\n\tvar TAG_NAMES = exports.TAG_NAMES = {\n\t    BASE: \"base\",\n\t    BODY: \"body\",\n\t    HEAD: \"head\",\n\t    HTML: \"html\",\n\t    LINK: \"link\",\n\t    META: \"meta\",\n\t    NOSCRIPT: \"noscript\",\n\t    SCRIPT: \"script\",\n\t    STYLE: \"style\",\n\t    TITLE: \"title\"\n\t};\n\t\n\tvar VALID_TAG_NAMES = exports.VALID_TAG_NAMES = Object.keys(TAG_NAMES).map(function (name) {\n\t    return TAG_NAMES[name];\n\t});\n\t\n\tvar TAG_PROPERTIES = exports.TAG_PROPERTIES = {\n\t    CHARSET: \"charset\",\n\t    CSS_TEXT: \"cssText\",\n\t    HREF: \"href\",\n\t    HTTPEQUIV: \"http-equiv\",\n\t    INNER_HTML: \"innerHTML\",\n\t    ITEM_PROP: \"itemprop\",\n\t    NAME: \"name\",\n\t    PROPERTY: \"property\",\n\t    REL: \"rel\",\n\t    SRC: \"src\"\n\t};\n\t\n\tvar REACT_TAG_MAP = exports.REACT_TAG_MAP = {\n\t    accesskey: \"accessKey\",\n\t    charset: \"charSet\",\n\t    class: \"className\",\n\t    contenteditable: \"contentEditable\",\n\t    contextmenu: \"contextMenu\",\n\t    \"http-equiv\": \"httpEquiv\",\n\t    itemprop: \"itemProp\",\n\t    tabindex: \"tabIndex\"\n\t};\n\t\n\tvar HELMET_PROPS = exports.HELMET_PROPS = {\n\t    DEFAULT_TITLE: \"defaultTitle\",\n\t    DEFER: \"defer\",\n\t    ENCODE_SPECIAL_CHARACTERS: \"encodeSpecialCharacters\",\n\t    ON_CHANGE_CLIENT_STATE: \"onChangeClientState\",\n\t    TITLE_TEMPLATE: \"titleTemplate\"\n\t};\n\t\n\tvar HTML_TAG_MAP = exports.HTML_TAG_MAP = Object.keys(REACT_TAG_MAP).reduce(function (obj, key) {\n\t    obj[REACT_TAG_MAP[key]] = key;\n\t    return obj;\n\t}, {});\n\t\n\tvar SELF_CLOSING_TAGS = exports.SELF_CLOSING_TAGS = [TAG_NAMES.NOSCRIPT, TAG_NAMES.SCRIPT, TAG_NAMES.STYLE];\n\t\n\tvar HELMET_ATTRIBUTE = exports.HELMET_ATTRIBUTE = \"data-react-helmet\";\n\n/***/ }),\n/* 368 */,\n/* 369 */,\n/* 370 */,\n/* 371 */,\n/* 372 */,\n/* 373 */,\n/* 374 */,\n/* 375 */\n/***/ (function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\n\t\"use strict\";\n\t\n\texports.__esModule = true;\n\t\n\tvar _extends = Object.assign || function (target) { for (var i = 1; i < arguments.length; i++) { var source = arguments[i]; for (var key in source) { if (Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(source, key)) { target[key] = source[key]; } } } return target; };\n\t\n\tvar _react = __webpack_require__(1);\n\t\n\tvar _react2 = _interopRequireDefault(_react);\n\t\n\tvar _index = __webpack_require__(382);\n\t\n\tvar _index2 = _interopRequireDefault(_index);\n\t\n\tvar _layoutIndex = __webpack_require__(315);\n\t\n\tvar _layoutIndex2 = _interopRequireDefault(_layoutIndex);\n\t\n\tfunction _interopRequireDefault(obj) { return obj && obj.__esModule ?

It analyzes\n * the geometry of elements, and observes when another responder (scroll view\n * etc) has stolen the touch lock. It notifies your component when it should\n * give feedback to the user. (bouncing/highlighting/unhighlighting).\n *\n * - When a touch was activated (typically you highlight)\n * - When a touch was deactivated (typically you unhighlight)\n * - When a touch was \"pressed\" - a touch ended while still within the geometry\n *   of the element, and no other element (like scroller) has \"stolen\" touch\n *   lock (\"responder\") (Typically you bounce the element).\n *\n * A good tap interaction isn't as simple as you might think. There should be a\n * slight delay before showing a highlight when starting a touch. If a\n * subsequent touch move exceeds the boundary of the element, it should\n * unhighlight, but if that same touch is brought back within the boundary, it\n * should rehighlight again. A touch can move in and out of that boundary\n * several times, each time toggling highlighting, but a \"press\" is only\n * triggered if that touch ends while within the element's boundary and no\n * scroller (or anything else) has stolen the lock on touches.\n *\n * To create a new type of component that handles interaction using the\n * `Touchable` mixin, do the following:\n *\n * - Initialize the `Touchable` state.\n *\n *   getInitialState: function() {\n *     return merge(this.touchableGetInitialState(), yourComponentState);\n *   }\n *\n * - Choose the rendered component who's touches should start the interactive\n *   sequence. On that rendered node, forward all `Touchable` responder\n *   handlers. You can choose any rendered node you like. Choose a node whose\n *   hit target you'd like to instigate the interaction sequence:\n *\n *   // In render function:\n *   return (\n *     <View\n *       onStartShouldSetResponder={this.touchableHandleStartShouldSetResponder}\n *       onResponderTerminationRequest={this.touchableHandleResponderTerminationRequest}\n *       onResponderGrant={this.touchableHandleResponderGrant}\n *       onResponderMove={this.touchableHandleResponderMove}\n *       onResponderRelease={this.touchableHandleResponderRelease}\n *       onResponderTerminate={this.touchableHandleResponderTerminate}>\n *       <View>\n *         Even though the hit detection/interactions are triggered by the\n *         wrapping (typically larger) node, we usually end up implementing\n *         custom logic that highlights this inner one.\n *       </View>\n *     </View>\n *   );\n *\n * - You may set up your own handlers for each of these events, so long as you\n *   also invoke the `touchable*` handlers inside of your custom handler.\n *\n * - Implement the handlers on your component class in order to provide\n *   feedback to the user. See documentation for each of these class methods\n *   that you should implement.\n *\n *   touchableHandlePress: function() {\n *      this.performBounceAnimation();  // or whatever you want to do.\n *   },\n *   touchableHandleActivePressIn: function() {\n *     this.beginHighlighting(...);  // Whatever you like to convey activation\n *   },\n *   touchableHandleActivePressOut: function() {\n *     this.endHighlighting(...);  // Whatever you like to convey deactivation\n *   },\n *\n * - There are more advanced methods you can implement (see documentation below):\n *   touchableGetHighlightDelayMS: function() {\n *     return 20;\n *   }\n *   // In practice, *always* use a predeclared constant (conserve memory).\n *   touchableGetPressRectOffset: function() {\n *     return {top: 20, left: 20, right: 20, bottom: 100};\n *   }\n */\n\n/**\n * Touchable states.\n */\nvar States = {\n  NOT_RESPONDER: 'NOT_RESPONDER', // Not the responder\n

We use `concat` to create a new array - mutating `this._data`,\n * e.g. with `this._data.push(newRowData)`, would be an error. `_rowHasChanged`\n * understands the shape of the row data and knows how to efficiently compare\n * it.\n *\n * ```\n * getInitialState: function() {\n *   var ds = new ListViewDataSource({rowHasChanged: this._rowHasChanged});\n *   return {ds};\n * },\n * _onDataArrived(newData) {\n *   this._data = this._data.concat(newData);\n *   this.setState({\n *     ds: this.state.ds.cloneWithRows(this._data)\n *   });\n * }\n * ```\n */\n\nvar ListViewDataSource = function () {\n  /**\n   * You can provide custom extraction and `hasChanged` functions for section\n   * headers and rows.

Integrate with your platform specific scroll\n * views, or even your custom built (every-frame animating) scroll views so that\n * all of these systems play well with the `ResponderEventPlugin`.\n *\n * iOS scroll event timing nuances:\n * ===============================\n *\n *\n * Scrolling without bouncing, if you touch down:\n * -------------------------------\n *\n * 1. `onMomentumScrollBegin` (when animation begins after letting up)\n *    ... physical touch starts ...\n * 2. `onTouchStartCapture`   (when you press down to stop the scroll)\n * 3. `onTouchStart`          (same, but bubble phase)\n * 4. `onResponderRelease`    (when lifting up - you could pause forever before * lifting)\n * 5. `onMomentumScrollEnd`\n *\n *\n * Scrolling with bouncing, if you touch down:\n * -------------------------------\n *\n * 1. `onMomentumScrollBegin` (when animation begins after letting up)\n *    ... bounce begins ...\n *    ... some time elapses ...\n *    ... physical touch during bounce ...\n * 2. `onMomentumScrollEnd`   (Makes no sense why this occurs first during bounce)\n * 3. `onTouchStartCapture`   (immediately after `onMomentumScrollEnd`)\n * 4. `onTouchStart`          (same, but bubble phase)\n * 5. `onTouchEnd`            (You could hold the touch start for a long time)\n * 6. `onMomentumScrollBegin` (When releasing the view starts bouncing back)\n *\n * So when we receive an `onTouchStart`, how can we tell if we are touching\n * *during* an animation (which then causes the animation to stop)? The only way\n * to tell is if the `touchStart` occurred immediately after the\n * `onMomentumScrollEnd`.\n *\n * This is abstracted out for you, so you can just call this.scrollResponderIsAnimating() if\n * necessary\n *\n * `ScrollResponder` also includes logic for blurring a currently focused input\n * if one is focused while scrolling. The `ScrollResponder` is a natural place\n * to put this logic since it can support not dismissing the keyboard while\n * scrolling, unless a recognized \"tap\"-like gesture has occurred.\n *\n * The public lifecycle API includes events for keyboard interaction, responder\n * interaction, and scrolling (among others). The keyboard callbacks\n * `onKeyboardWill/Did/*` are *global* events, but are invoked on scroll\n * responder's props so that you can guarantee that the scroll responder's\n * internal state has been updated accordingly (and deterministically) by\n * the time the props callbacks are invoke. Otherwise, you would always wonder\n * if the scroll responder is currently in a state where it recognizes new\n * keyboard positions etc. If coordinating scrolling with keyboard movement,\n * *always* use these hooks instead of listening to your own global keyboard\n * events.\n *\n * Public keyboard lifecycle API: (props callbacks)\n *\n * Standard Keyboard Appearance Sequence:\n *\n *   this.props.onKeyboardWillShow\n *   this.props.onKeyboardDidShow\n *\n * `onScrollResponderKeyboardDismissed` will be invoked if an appropriate\n * tap inside the scroll responder's scrollable region was responsible\n * for the dismissal of the keyboard. There are other reasons why the\n * keyboard could be dismissed.\n *\n *   this.props.onScrollResponderKeyboardDismissed\n *\n * Standard Keyboard Hide Sequence:\n *\n *   this.props.onKeyboardWillHide\n *   this.props.onKeyboardDidHide\n */\n\nvar emptyObject = {}; /**\n                       * Copyright (c) 2016-present, Nicolas Gallagher.\n                       * Copyright (c) 2015-present, Facebook, Inc.\n                       * All rights reserved.\n                       *\n                       * This source code is licensed under the BSD-style license found in the\n                       * LICENSE file in the root directory of this source tree.\n                       *\n                       * @providesModule ScrollResponder\n                       * \n                       */\n\nvar IS_ANIMATING_TOUCH_START_THRESHOLD_MS = 16;\n\nvar ScrollResponderMixin = {\n  // mixins: [Subscribable.Mixin],\n  scrollResponderMixinGetInitialState: function scrollResponderMixinGetInitialState() {\n    return {\n      isTouching: false,\n      lastMomentumScrollBeginTime: 0,\n      lastMomentumScrollEndTime: 0,\n\n      // Reset to false every time becomes responder.

When two touches move in parallel five\n   * pixels in the same direction, the cumulative distance is five, not ten. If\n   * two touches start, one moves five in a direction, then stops and the other\n   * touch moves fives in the same direction, the cumulative distance is ten.\n   *\n   * This logic requires a kind of processing of time \"clusters\" of touch events\n   * so that two touch moves that essentially occur in parallel but move every\n   * other frame respectively, are considered part of the same movement.\n   *\n   * Explanation of some of the non-obvious fields:\n   *\n   * - moveX/moveY: If no move event has been observed, then `(moveX, moveY)` is\n   *   invalid. If a move event has been observed, `(moveX, moveY)` is the\n   *   centroid of the most recently moved \"cluster\" of active touches.\n   *   (Currently all move have the same timeStamp, but later we should add some\n   *   threshold for what is considered to be \"moving\"). If a palm is\n   *   accidentally counted as a touch, but a finger is moving greatly, the palm\n   *   will move slightly, but we only want to count the single moving touch.\n   * - x0/y0: Centroid location (non-cumulative) at the time of becoming\n   *   responder.\n   * - dx/dy: Cumulative touch distance - not the same thing as sum of each touch\n   *   distance. Accounts for touch moves that are clustered together in time,\n   *   moving the same direction.

Therefore, `PanResponder` does not call\n   * `onResponderMove` passed the first dispatch.
