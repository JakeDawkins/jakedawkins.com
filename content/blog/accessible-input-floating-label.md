## Introduction

Many designers love inputs like these; with a label floating over the input
that moves out of the way for text input when a user focuses the input. Of course
they love it, though! [Inputs need labels](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/forms/labels/),
and labels take up space. Having a label live inside the bounds of an input makes
sense and helps maintain page flow, eliminating yet another item that could
clutter up an otherwise clean UI.

![text inputs in different states, like focused, errored, empty](/images/blog/input-designs.png)

There are a dozen tutorials all over the internet on how to build this style of
input, but I've yet to come across one focusing on the specific set of constraints
that this post will focus on:

1. Accessible first. It must be [perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/intro.html#introduction-fourprincs-head)
2. Use Typescript, React, and Tailwind
   - We'll also use a css module here for some of the more complex css that
     tailwind doesn't natively support. If you use Next.js, [CSS modules are supported out-of-the-box](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/styling/css-modules), but if not, you can certainly use whatever CSS
     strategy your app supports.
3. Support error states gracefully
4. Support input masks (don't worry, if you don't need this, it's easy to leave off)

With these requirements in-place, let's get to work! Or, if you're just looking
for some code to copy/paste, you can jump [straight to the completed source code](#putting-it-all-together).

> Much of the CSS used in this post originally comes from [this blog post by Stanko TadiÄ‡](https://muffinman.io/blog/css-only-floating-input-labels/). For more of a deep dive on how the CSS here works, read his post!

## Just my type

For the component types, we want this component to act very much like any other
`input`, with some additions; `label`, `mask`, and `errorMessage`. Extending `React`'s native
`input` type makes passing along props later that much easier.

```typescript
import { InputHTMLAttributes } from 'react';

type FloatingLabelInputProps = InputHTMLAttributes<HTMLInputElement> & {
  label: string;
  mask?: string;
  className?: string;
  errorMessage?: string;
};
```

## A little bit of HTML

Next up, we'll set up a basic HTML `input` and `label`, all wrapped in a `div` that
helps us position everything right.

```jsx
// forwardRef will make sure tools like ...register from react-hook-form still work
export default React.forwardRef(function FloatingLabelInput(
  {
    label,
    mask,
    className = '',
    errorMessage,
    ...inputProps
  }: FloatingLabelInputProps,
  ref,
) {
  // if there is a passed in id, use that. Otherwise, generate one from the label
  const id =
    inputProps.id ||
    label.toLowerCase().replace(/ /g, '-') +
      '-' +
      Math.random().toString(16).slice(2);

  return (
    <div className={className}>
      <input
        placeholder=" "
        id={id}
        // you'll want to use your own theme colors here, like gray-100
        className={`bg-lightestGray ${
          inputProps.disabled ? ' cursor-not-allowed' : ''
        }`}
        {...inputProps}
      />
      {/* the label here needs to be _after_ the <input> for the
      css to work for the floating label later*/}
      <label htmlFor={id}>{label}</label>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Here, we set up a few things:

1. We need an `id` to link the `input` and `label`. If the user passes in an `id` to the component, we'll use that for
   the input. If not, we'll generate one from the text of the `label`.
2. We then use that `id` in the `label`'s `htmlFor` prop to link the two.

## A little bit of CSS

Above, we set up the most basic of styling for the `input`. We'll split up styles
into three categories

1. Basic shape and styles not dependent on props (aside from `value`)
   - In the accompanying css file
2. Tailwind theme or prop-dependent styles
   - In the component file
3. Value-dependent styles
   - We use some pseudo classes for this, so this will also live in the CSS module

### Why pseudo classes instead of an onChange callback?

A previous version of this component I was using did everything in React with tailwind
classes, but the critical issue was that the component couldn't be used natively by
`react-hook-form`, whose `register` function for integrating easily with inputs uses
`ref`s to set input values asynchronously after data updates. In this case, there was no
easy way for the component to difinitively know when the input had a value and move the
label out of the way of the input text.

## Placing the label

First up, in our `index.module.css` file:

```css
/* The wrapping div of the input and label */
.container {
  position: relative;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  min-width: 0;
}

/* Label styles while positioned in the "placeholder" state, in the 
   middle of the input */
.container .label {
  position: absolute;
  pointer-events: none;
  transform: translate(0, 23px) scale(1);
  /* makes sure we can track the position of the label appropriately */
  transform-origin: top left;
  transition: 150ms cubic-bezier(0, 0, 0.2, 1) 0ms;
  font-size: 16px;
  line-height: 1;
  left: 16px;
  min-width: 0;
}

.container .input {
  display: flex;
  padding: 24px 16px 8px;
  height: 60px;
  border-radius: 8px;
  min-width: 0;
}
```

Now, we need to apply these styles to our component. The only thing we need to do
if we're using CSS modules is import the classes and assign them to the right
components

```jsx
// FloatingLabelInput.tsx
import styles from './index.module.css';

// the wrapping container:
<div className={styles.container + ' ' + className} />

// the input itself
<input
  // ...
  className={styles.input + `bg-lightestGray ${
    inputProps.disabled ? ' cursor-not-allowed' : ''
  }`}
/>

// and lastly the label
<label
  htmlFor={id}
  className={styles.label}
/>
```

Now, the classes we just built should be automatically assigned to the components:

![A basic input with a label inside, in the middle of the input](/images/blog/basic-input.png)

## Moving the label

There are a two states where we want the label to jump to the top of the input:

1. The `input` is focused
2. The `input` has a text value

For the case of the input being focused, we can add the following CSS

```css
/* when the input is focused, do this to the label */
.container:focus-within .label {
  transform: translate(0, 12px) scale(0.8);
  color: #5e71c4;
  font-weight: bold;
}
```

![Input with a label that moves whenever focused](/images/blog/input-moving.gif)

As for when the input has a value, we need to be a little more clever. First up,
we need to make sure our `input` always has a label. We'll make it invisible, but
we can just assign it a string with a single space `placeholder=" "`.

Then, in our CSS, add the following:

```css
.input::placeholder {
  color: transparent;
}

.input:not(:placeholder-shown) + .label {
  transform: translate(0, 12px) scale(0.8);
  font-weight: bold;
}
```

The first chunk here makes the input's placeholder transparent. The second is the
interesting part. It says that whenever the `input`'s `placeholder` is _not_ shown,
slide up the label and make the text bold. When are placeholders not shown? When
the input has a value! In Safari, this only works with an explicitly defined
placeholder, thus the `placeholder` prop usage above.

Unfortunately, this means you can't actually use a placeholder value for the input.
But using a descriptive label should be enough in most cases. You could also add
a description text field to show below the input with [`aria-describedby`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-describedby).

## Input masking

Input masks are extremely useful when users need to enter a specific formatted
string like credit card numbers, expirations, security codes, and more.
[React Input Mask](https://github.com/sanniassin/react-input-mask) is a library
that does just this, and closely matches the API of a basic `input`, making it an
excellent drop-in replacement for a base `input` when needed.

In our case, we'll use `react-input-mask` whenever a `mask` is passed to our
component, and react's base `input` any other time. We can pull our `input`'s
props out into a memoized object to prevent recalculation as much as possible:

```jsx
  const inputCompProps = useMemo(
    () => ({
      ...inputProps,
      placeholder: ' ',
      id: id,
      className:
        styles.input +
        ' bg-lightestGray ' +
        (inputProps.disabled ? ' cursor-not-allowed' : '') +
    }),
    [id, inputProps],
  );
```

And in the return (we also add in our `ref` here, which we already set up from
the forwardRef function at the start):

```jsx
{
  mask ? (
    <ReactInputMask
      {...inputCompProps}
      mask={mask}
      maskPlaceholder={null}
      // @ts-ignore
      ref={ref}
    />
  ) : (
    <input
      {...inputCompProps}
      // @ts-ignore
      ref={ref}
    />
  );
}
```

![The input label moves when the user clicks into it, and an expiration date is automatically formatted with a / between the month and year](/images/blog/input-mask.gif)

With that, the input should work with a mask, no problem! Notice the `/`
that gets added automatically when the user types. This is accomplished by passing
in a `mask="99/99"` prop to the component.

## What about errors?

Once we've gotten the component setup and working in it's "happy path", we can add
an error state using [proper aria attributes for errors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-errormessage)
using the `aria-errormessage` and `aria-invalid` props. We'll assume an added
`errorMessage: string` prop.

```jsx
// inputCompProps
'aria-errormessage': errorMessage ? `${id}-error` : undefined,
'aria-invalid': !!errorMessage,

// rendered error message
{errorMessage ? (
  <p
    className="ml-4 mt-1 text-darkerRed text-sm font-bold"
    id={`${id}-error`}
  >
    {errorMessage}
  </p>
) : null}
```

## Putting it all together

With that, the component is complete! For easier copying, here is the complete
source code:

## Conclusion

We built this using only a few imports, a few tailwind classes, some CSS and a
bit of React. It's a component that is keyboard and screen-reader accessible by
default, and usable among a wide range of cases including with tools like `react-hook-form`.

You could easily extend this component to include custom styling or label logic
by adding more props, but did I leave something out? Could I have improved this
or made it easier? Let me know on [Threads](https://threads.net/@jakedawkins).
Or give me a follow to stay in the loop for future posts like this!
