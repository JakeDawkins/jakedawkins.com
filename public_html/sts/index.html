					<p>
						Skepticism and cynicism are often confused.<br />
						To help to explain the difference between the two, I will use some fantastic drawings.<br /><br />
						<strong>Like this:</strong>
					</p>
					<!-- greet image -->
					<div class='col-sm-4 col-sm-offset-4' >
						<img class='center-block img-responsive' src='img/01_greet.png' />	
					</div>

				<div class='col-sm-12'>
					<br />
					<p>So let's begin by meeting our heroes...</p>
					<br />
				</div>

				<!-- intro to our heroes -->
				<div class='col-sm-12'>
					<div class='col-sm-4 col-sm-offset-2'>

				<div class='col-sm-12'>
					<br />
					<p>These two will be our illustrations for how skeptics and cynics look in different scenarios. <br />Let's begin</p>
					<br />
				</div>
			</div> <!-- end row -->

			<!-- SCENARIO 1 -->
			<div class='color2 row'>
				<div class='col-sm-12'>
					<br />
					<h2>Scenario 1</h2>
					<p>
						Steve and Cindy both meet people who challenge their views on
						politics (this never happens in real life).
					</p>
					<br />
				</div>

				<!-- pic block -->
				<div class='col-sm-12'>
					<div class='col-sm-4 col-sm-offset-2'>
						<img class='center-block img-responsive' src='img/02_ss.png' />
						<p>
							<br />
							Steve is open to the ideas that the person proposes. Steve has
							ideas of his own, however, so he would require evidence to 
							consider changing his opinion.	
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class='col-sm-4'>
						<img class='center-block img-responsive' src='img/02_cc.png' />
						<p>
							<br />
							Cindy is a firm believer that she is right and thinks that no
							amount of evidence could change that.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>
			</div>
			<!-- END SCENARIO -->

			<!-- SCENARIO 2 -->
			<div class='color1 row'>
				<div class='col-sm-12'>
					<br />
					<h2>Scenario 2</h2>
					<p>
						Steve and Cindy are working in a group, and the group is faced
						with a difficult problem to solve. <br />The group proposes an idea
						that Steve and Cindy both disagree with.
					</p>
					<br />
				</div>

				<!-- pic block -->
				<div class='col-sm-12'>
					<div class='col-sm-4 col-sm-offset-2'>
						<img class='center-block img-responsive' src='img/03_ss.png' />
						<p>
							<br />
							Steve considers the problem and the proposed solution. He thinks
							of a better solution, and proposes it instead.	
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class='col-sm-4'>
						<img class='center-block img-responsive' src='img/03_cc.png' />
						<p>
							<br />
							Cindy is focused on the fact that the solution is wrong. Rather than
							proposing a new solution, she simply shuts down the others.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>
			</div>
			<!-- END SCENARIO -->

			<!-- SCENARIO 3 -->
			<div class='color2 row'>
				<div class='col-sm-12'>
					<br />
					<h2>Scenario 3</h2>
					<p>
						Someone in Steve and Cindy's group skipped the team's meeting, <br/>causing
						them to both stay up all night to finish the project.
					</p>
					<br />
				</div>

				<!-- pic block -->
				<div class='col-sm-12'>
					<div class='col-sm-4 col-sm-offset-2'>
						<img class='center-block img-responsive' src='img/04_ss.png' />
						<p>
							<br />
							Steve is angry at the person, but realizes that he may not know
							the whole situation. He thinks the best of people first,
							assuming that the person did not mean to offload so much work
							onto the rest of the team.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class='col-sm-4'>
						<img class='center-block img-responsive' src='img/04_cc.png' />
						<p>
							<br />
							Cindy is also angry at the person, but chooses to blame the person's
							character. She assumes the worst of people first, not willing to give
							the person's situation any thought.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>

					<div class='col-sm-4'>
						<img class='center-block img-responsive' src='img/05_cc.png' />
						<p>
							<br />
							Cindy has had a hard day too, and is done dealing with people
							entirely. She wouldn't even pose for an appropriate picture.
