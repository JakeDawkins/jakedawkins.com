  bio:
    "I'm Jake! I was born and raised in South Carolina, but recently relocated to New York City. I'm currently lead engineer on the mobile team at Major League Soccer. I work with React, React Native, and GraphQL to build a next generation of fan experiences. I thoroughly enjoy working with others, teaching, and learning new things.\n\nThis site is just a summary of some of the things I've been working on. It is not at all exhaustive, and will continue to change. \n\nIf you would like to reach out to me or keep up with what I'm doing, click on any of the links above.",
